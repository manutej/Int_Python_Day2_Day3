    "## Wisdom for Correct Logging Practices\n",
    "### 1. Use Different Levels Appropriately: \n",
    "Utilize logging levels to differentiate the importance of messages. This helps in filtering logs for relevant information.\n",
    "### 2. Be Descriptive in Log Messages: \n",
    "Include enough context in your log messages to make them useful for debugging. Mention the module, method, or any identifiers related to the event.\n",
    "### 3. Avoid Sensitive Information\n",
    "Never log sensitive information like passwords or personal user data. This is crucial for security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Use Rotating File Handlers for File Logs: \n",
    "Implement log rotation to manage file sizes and maintain old logs without consuming too much disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Configure Loggers in a Central Place: \n",
    "Set up your logging configurations centrally, ideally at the entry point of your application, to ensure consistency across modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Leverage fileConfig or dictConfig for Complex Configurations:\n",
    "\n",
    " For applications with multiple loggers or complex logging needs, use configuration files or dictionaries. This keeps the configuration organized and easily maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Add Contextual Information When Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "For debugging complex issues, contextual information (like user ID or transaction ID) can be invaluable. Use structured logging or custom log fields to include this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Test Your Logging: \n",
    "Ensure your logging works as expected by including tests for critical log statements. This can be part of your application's testing strategy."

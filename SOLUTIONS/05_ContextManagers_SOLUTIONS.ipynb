    "# **Context Managers in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ’¡Context managers are a feature of Python that allows for the setup and teardown of resources automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are often used to manage resources such as \n",
    "- file streams\n",
    "- locks\n",
    "- database connections \n",
    "\n",
    "in a safe, clean, and concise manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Context Manager?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ’¡ A context manager in Python is an object designed to be used in a **`with`** statement, which guarantees that resources are properly acquired and released, even if an error occurs during their use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The **`with`** Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`with`** statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks in so-called **context managers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It ensures that the necessary \"setup\" and \"cleanup\" actions are taken, regardless of whether the block of code executed successfully or raised an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ’¡ The **`with`** statement is used to wrap the execution of a block of code. It ensures that predefined cleanup actions are performed after the block is executed, which is useful for resource management tasks like opening and closing files."

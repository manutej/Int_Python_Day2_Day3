    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a comprehensive system to schedule and manage various types of events, offering features to add new events, update existing ones, query events by date or type, and send reminders for upcoming events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Data Structures**: Use `namedtuple` for representing events and `defaultdict` for organizing events by date and type.\n",
    "2. **Event Addition and Update**: Implement functions to add and update events, including details such as title, date, type, and description.\n",
    "3. **Query Functionality**: Enable searching for events by date range or type, showcasing the use of `filter` and list comprehensions.\n",
    "4. **Reminders**: Use a scheduled task (potentially with `sched` or a simple loop with sleep for a mock-up) to check for and display upcoming event reminders.\n",
    "5. **User Interaction**: Develop an interactive CLI for users to interact with the system, adding and querying events.\n",
    "6. **Best Practices**: Incorporate logging for actions, input validation with decorators, and type hints for function signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TASK:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sketch out some pseudocode and a process as to how you would tackle this with some of the advanced data types we have covered so far. You can go into as much detail as possible.\n",

    "2. Leverage Generative AI to see if you can get an initial piece of code that is of \"high quality\" that incorporates your pseudocode and the requirements of the task above. \n",

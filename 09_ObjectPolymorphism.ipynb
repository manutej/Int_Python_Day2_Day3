    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables you to write code that can work with objects of multiple types, providing flexibility and extensibility to your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of polymorphism in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Method Overriding** (Runtime Polymorphism)\n",
    "2. **Method Overloading** (Compile-time Polymorphism)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with Method Overriding…\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Overriding\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Method overriding occurs when a subclass defines a method with the same name as a method in its superclass.\n",
    "- The overridden method in the subclass provides a different implementation than the one in the superclass.\n",
    "- When the method is called on an instance of the subclass, the overridden method in the subclass is executed instead of the method in the superclass.\n",
    "- Method overriding allows subclasses to modify or extend the behavior inherited from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates method overriding:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Social Media Notifications (Method Overriding)\n",
    "Problem Description:\n",
    "You are building a social media application that sends notifications to users for different types of events. \n",
